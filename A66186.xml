            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when you Enter upon this Buſineſs, I Believe you will think it Neceſſary to take Care of the Repairs of the Ships, and of the Fortifications, without which Our Fleet cannot be Safe, when it is in Harbour.</p>
            <p>I cannot Omit to put you in mind of another Matter, in which ſo great a Number of My Subjects is concerned, and wherein the Honour of the Kingdom and the Faith of Parliaments is ſo far Engaged, that Our future Security ſeems to Depend upon it; I Mean, the making good the Deficiencies of the Fonds, and the Diſcharging the Debts contracted by reaſon of the War. And till We may be ſo happy to ſee the Publick Debts paid, I ſhall Hope, that no Seſſion will end without ſomething done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Leſſening them. While I am ſpeaking to you on this Head, I think My Self obliged to Mention, with a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Concern, a Debt which is Owing to the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the State whereof I have Ordered to be laid before you.</p>

And I do faithfully Aſſure you, that no Part of what is given ſhall be diverted from any Purpoſe for which it is deſigned.</p>
               <p>I believe the Nation is already ſenſible of the good Effects of Peace, by the manifeſt Increaſe of Trade, which I ſhall make it My Buſineſs to Incourage by all means in My Power. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it might receive an Advantage, if ſome good Bill were prepared for the more effectual Preventing and Puniſhing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and Clandeſtine Trading; which does not only tend to Defraud the Publick, but Prejudices the fair Merchant, and Diſcourages Our own Manufactures.</p>
               <p>The Increaſe of the Poor is become a Burden to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and their looſe and idle Life does in ſome meaſure contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to that Depravation of Manners, which is complained of, (I fear with too much Reaſon) whether the Ground of this Evil be from Defects in the Laws already made, or in the Execution of them, deſerves your Conſideration. As it is an indiſpenſable Duty, that the Poor, who are not able to help themſelves, ſhould be maintain'd, ſo I cannot but think it extremely Deſirable, that ſuch as are able and willing ſhould not want Imployment, and ſuch as are obſtinate and unwilling ſhould be compell'd to Labour.</p>
